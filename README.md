# A code base for running the four main models of racially polarized ranked choice voting

Copy and adapt run_all_models_and_print_output.py to cycle through all four models and all five scenarios. The results will be printed as rows of values separated by &s for easy input into LaTeX tables.

The template_table.tex file contains a basic template for recording these results, including a very brief overview of the models and a blank table with headers.
